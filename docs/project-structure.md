# üç∫ Project Structure

## File structure

`index.js` is the entry-point for our file, and is mandatory.
`App.tsx` is the main-point for our application. We can store global variables here, thus the Redux store and lightmode/darkmode variables wrap the entire app in this file.

- `/android` - contains native code specific to the Android OS.
  - `build.gradle` - Top level build file where configuration options to all modules of the applciation. 
  - `/app` - Native Polyamanita code
      - `build.gradle` - Specific build modular configuration for Polyamanita.
      - `/src/main` - 
        - `/assets` - Context of files not native to Android are placed here. The tensor-flow model, fonts, and mushroom labels reside here.  
        - `/java/com/polyamanita` - native modules to run on front end. Shroomalzyer code sits here.
        - `/res` - native application icons and splashscreen handeling.
- `/docs` - as the name suggests - any docs.
- `/node_modules` - React Native packages added with yarn package manager.
- `/src` - contains rendered JS and style code.
  - `/api` - generic network handling with API constants
  - `/assets/` - non-code files, like icons, images, fonts, etc.
  - `/navigation` - react navigation handeling, components and constants.
  - `/redux` - redux store, reducerrs and constants.
  - `/screens` - contains all screens/pages of the application. (detailed section in next section)
  - `/shared` - whole app-wide shared
    - `/components` - app-wide shared components
    - `/constants` - app-wide shared constant variables
    - `/localization` - app-wide localization
    - `/theme` - app-wide theme which contains `color palette` and `fonts`
    - `/wrappers` - app-wide component wrappers
  - `/storage` - anything dealing with file inout/output, searching files, etc.
  - `/utils` - generic util functions
  - `index.js` - the starting place for our app
  - `App.tsx` - the main place for our app
- `.babelrc` - local configuration file for importing modules across the application. Cleans up import statements.
- `.commitlintrc.json` - a git commit linter
- `.eslintrc.js` - a set of rules fixes syntactic problems across application.
- `.prettierrc` - Prettier rules that formats code to enforce code styling consistancy.
- `babel.config.js` - instantiates context from native module plugins to use on front end (like the Shroomalyzer).
- `package.json` - Node modules and versioning.
- `README.md` - Remote repository text document.
- `tsconfig.json` - TS rules and babel filepath context for TS


## src/screens structure

For each screen on the application, the current structure has it so where each unique screen gets its own directory. The only case of not following that convention is if there is a complete similarity to screens to prevent clouding up ./screens with similar screen.

Each screen can have the following subd-rectories.
- `screen.tsx` - screen component
- `screen.style.ts` - styling for screens sub-components
- `utils.ts | /utils` - module functions that are ran on the screen.
- `/components` - organizational sub directory to put uniquely created components.
- `/wrappers` - organizational sub directory to put uniquely created component wrappers.
